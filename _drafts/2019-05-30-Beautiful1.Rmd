Sometimes you like to produce maps with special layouts. I specially like maps with modified geometries, e.g. simplifiying the original shapes to squares or dots. When doing a little search over the web I found the fantastic post [Fishnets and Honeycomb: Square vs. Hexagonal Spatial Grids](http://strimas.com/spatial/hexagonal-grids/) by [Matt Strimas-Mackey](http://strimas.com/about/) that was a huge inspiration (by the way, don't miss [his blog](http://strimas.com/#posts), full of very interesting pieces of work). 

The only thing I was not completely comfortable with was that the post used the [old-fashioned](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/intro.html#the-history-of-r-spatial) `sp` package instead of my personal fav, the 'sf' package, (the post was published in 2016, note that author has also moved to the `sf` package since then). So I decided to explore further options with `sf`.

The approach is similar (using grids over a map and work with that) but using [`st_make_grid`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sf/versions/0.7-4/topics/st_make_grid). I also expanded it by grouping the grids and also producing dots over the geometries. So basically I produced 5 variations of the map:

| Type          | Replacement | Grouped  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| **Fishnet** | Square | No
| **Puzzle** | Square | Yes
| **Honeycomb** | Hexagon | No
| **Hexbin** | Hexagon | Yes
| **Pixel** | Dot | No


## Required R packages

```{r libs, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, tidy='styler'}
library(sf)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(dplyr)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

### Working with square grids

Let's use the `square` options of `st_make_grid` and play a bit with it.

```{r 20190530_preparing, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, tidy='styler', dpi=90, fig.align='center'}
europe  <- ne_download(50,
                       type="map_subunits", 
                       returnclass = "sf",
                       destdir = tempdir()) %>%
  subset(CONTINENT=="Europe") %>%
  subset(!NAME_EN %in% c("Jan Mayen","Svalbard","Russia"))
#Excluding for plotting purposes only

# Projecting and cleaning
europe=st_transform(europe,3857) %>% select(NAME_EN,ADM0_A3)
initial = europe
initial$index_target = 1:nrow(initial)
target = st_geometry(initial)

```

{: .box-warning}
<i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> **Warning:** The `cellsize` should be established in the same unit that the projection (in this case is meters). Pay special attention on this, given that if the parameter is too small (meaning that the grid is too dense) **R** could crash easily.

```{r 20190530_squares, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, tidy='styler',fig.width=700/90, fig.height=350/90, dpi=90, fig.align='center'}


grid = st_make_grid(
  target,
  100*1000, # Kms
  crs = st_crs(initial),
  what = "polygons",
  square = TRUE
  )
# Make sf
grid = st_sf(index = 1:length(lengths(grid)), grid) # Add index

#We identify the grids that belongs to a entity by assessing the centroid 
cent_grid = st_centroid(grid)
cent_merge = st_join(cent_grid, initial["index_target"], left = F)
grid_new = inner_join(grid, st_drop_geometry(cent_merge))

fishnet_geom = aggregate(
  grid_new,
  by = list(grid_new$index_target),
  FUN = min,
  do_union = FALSE
)

#Fishnet
Fishgeom = aggregate(
  grid_new,
  by = list(grid_new$index_target),
  FUN = min,
  do_union = FALSE
)

#Lets add the df
Fishnet=left_join(Fishgeom %>%
                    select(index_target),
                  st_drop_geometry(initial)) %>% 
  select(-index_target)

# Now lets create the Puzzle

Puzzlegeom=aggregate(
  grid_new,
  by = list(grid_new$index_target),
  FUN = min,
  do_union = TRUE # This is the only piece that changes!!!
  )

Puzzle=left_join(Puzzlegeom %>%
                   select(index_target),
                 st_drop_geometry(initial)) %>% 
  select(-index_target)


par(mfrow=c(1,2),mar=c(1,1,1,1))
plot(st_geometry(Fishnet),col=brewer.pal(12,"Blues"), main="Fishnet")
plot(st_geometry(Puzzle),col=brewer.pal(12,"Blues"), main="Puzzle")

```
