Sometimes you like to produce maps with special layouts. I specially
like maps with modified geometries, e.g. simplifiying the original
shapes to squares or dots. When doing a little search over the web I
found the fantastic post [Fishnets and Honeycomb: Square vs. Hexagonal
Spatial Grids](http://strimas.com/spatial/hexagonal-grids/) by [Matt
Strimas-Mackey](http://strimas.com/about/) that was a huge inspiration
(by the way, don’t miss [his blog](http://strimas.com/#posts), full of
very interesting pieces of work).

The only thing I was not completely comfortable with was that the post
used the
[old-fashioned](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/intro.html#the-history-of-r-spatial)
`sp` package instead of my personal fav, the ‘sf’ package, (the post was
published in 2016, note that author has also moved to the `sf` package
since then). So I decided to explore further options with `sf`.

The approach is similar (using grids over a map and work with that) but
using
[`st_make_grid`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/sf/versions/0.7-4/topics/st_make_grid).
I also expanded it by grouping the grids and also producing dots over
the geometries. So basically I produced 5 variations of the map:

| Type          | Replacement | Grouped |
| ------------- | :---------: | ------: |
| **Fishnet**   |   Square    |      No |
| **Puzzle**    |   Square    |     Yes |
| **Honeycomb** |   Hexagon   |      No |
| **Hexbin**    |   Hexagon   |     Yes |
| **Pixel**     |     Dot     |      No |

## Required R packages

``` r
library(sf)
library(rnaturalearth)
library(dplyr)
```
